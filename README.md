# R Boot Camp for Duke Data+ Students

Below outlines some materials aimed in helping Data+ students gain the required R expertise to do basic Data Science. There are two major components:

1) R basics with `swirl`
2) The `data.table` package

## R Scripts

`init_swirl_courses.R` â€” running this script installs `swirl` and the recommended R courses.

## `swirl`

Learning R will be self-paced using an interactive console program called [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/). 

Information about courses can be found on the swirl dev teams [github repo](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses#swirl-courses).

### Recommended `swirl` Course Completion Order

The following courses can be installed by running the `init_swirl_courses.R`. The order of completion that will best suite Data+ students is as follows (subject to change):

1. R Programming Alt
4. Open Intro
2. Data Analysis
6. Getting and Cleaning
7. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp
5. Regression Models

## `data.table` package

Coming soon.
