# R Boot Camp for Duke Data+ Students

Below outlines some materials aimed in helping Data+ students gain the required R expertise to do basic Data Science. There are two major components:

1. R basics with `swirl`
2. The `data.table` package

## R Scripts

`init_swirl_courses.R` â€” running this script will install `swirl` and the recommended courses.

## `swirl` courses

Learning the basics of R will be self-paced using an interactive console program called [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/). 

Information about courses can be found on the swirl dev teams [github repo](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses#swirl-courses).

### Recommended `swirl` Course Completion Order

The following courses can be installed by running the `init_swirl_courses.R`. The order of completion that will best suite Data+ students is as follows (subject to change):

1. R Programming Alt
4. Open Intro
2. Data Analysis
6. Getting and Cleaning
7. Exploratory Data Analysis
8. Exploratory Data Analysis with `data.table` *(**NOT SWIRL** - see next section)*
3. Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp *(time permitting)*
5. Regression Models *(time permitting)*

## Exploratory Data Analysis with `data.table`

An introduction to using `data.table` for Exploratory Data Analysis can be found over at [David Robinson's R Data lessons page](http://varianceexplained.org/RData/).
